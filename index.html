          <h2>LINE TYPES AND USAGE</h2>
          <div class="fundamental-content">
            <img src="images/line.jpg" alt="line type" height="200" />
            <p>
              The varieties of lines that exist are numerous. Each type tends to
              work well in certain circumstances, and less well in others. There
              aren’t really any rules when it comes to line, save for the fact
              that you should get a sense of how to wield them.

          <h2>PERSPECTIVE</h2>
          <div class="fundamental-content" id="perspective">
            <p>
              Perspective is the use of lines and points to ensure your shapes
              align with a particular angle. It can be one of the most daunting
              fundamentals of drawing to the beginner, but I urge you to set
              emotions aside and do some simple perspective exercises. Most
              often, perspective comes in one, two, or three vanishing points,
              and we use these to get interesting and accurate results in our
              drawings. With it you can create a great deal of pictorial depth.

          <h2>VALUES & LIGHT</h2>
          <div class="fundamental-content">
            <img
              src="images/values and light.png"
              alt="values & light"
              height="200"
            />
            <p>
              Values and light are integral to generating appealing and readable
              pictures, as well as defining volume and form. Values range from
              pure black to pure white, with every imaginable gradient of gray
              in between. Light is how we attempt to replicate the effect that
              the visible ultraviolet spectrum has upon our ability to see. In
              other words, we’re taking photons (particles of light) and
              bouncing them around the objects in our scene to present them in
              the best way possible. We can consider various types of daylight
              and artificial light, or the lack thereof, which is shadow.

        <div>
          <h2>EDGES</h2>
          <p>
            Edges are what we use to define our mark-making. They range from
            completely imperceptible (like atmosphere) to soft (think clouds or
            folds in fine fabric) and finally all the way to sharp and
            pronounced, like the edge of a knife. Edges are often the
            least-considered element by beginners, because there’s much more to
            worry about than how things are flowing into one another in terms of
            our rendering and mark-making. <br /><br />
            Learning to wield effective edges permits us to create the greatest
            amount of believability. When form is transitioning sharply or
            softly, we visually “buy” the way things are looking. Next time you
            have the inkling, look at the edge of a shadow and see if it’s
            sharp, soft, or where it gets lost entirely. Shadows, Light, clouds,
            and clothing are some of the best places to start to notice and
            categorize edges.

          <h2>PROPORTION</h2>
          <div class="fundamental-content" id="proportion">
            <p>
              Measuring elements of the picture plane next to one another.
              Proportions are how we achieve scale and foreshortening. Most
              humans are approximately 7.5 heads tall, for example. We can break
              down the proportions of the human figure further, or we can
              transpose the idea of proportion to machinery, buildings, or
              virtually anything else we’d like to draw. presenting proportions
              properly or playing with them imaginatively is a potent way to
              amplify your drawing prowess.

        <div>
          <h2>COMPOSITION</h2>
          <p>
            Composition is the flow and arrangement of elements on the picture
            plane. A musician must compose the notes in their song, they must
            arrange the various instruments and sounds in a certain way to
            convey the concept of their tune. Layering things like drums,
            grooves, melody, and chord structures. <br /><br />
            When it comes to creating art, we’re composing the fundamentals
            we’re discussing in this post, as well as the actual factors that
            we’re choosing to place on the picture plane. For now, all you
            should keep in mind is that there should be a focal point (the area
            with the most contrast and interest) as well as elements that subtly
            or not-so-subtly point to it. When we stack elements within the
            confines of the picture plane, we create motion, frames, and
            inferred lines - and once you learn to read how these visually
            “vibrate” you’ll start to develop an intuitive understanding of
            composition along with your theoretical one.

          <h2>CONSTRUCTION</h2>
          <div class="fundamental-content">
            <img
              src="images/construction.png"
              alt="construction"
              height="300"
            />
            <p>
              Construction is how we build and interlock shapes and forms on the
              picture plane. It’s the A-to-Z process of generating the drawing
              we’re after. We will usually use some form of light guidelines
              sketched in, some degree of perspective, and a fair amount of
              simplification. These order themselves aright in order to carry
              our drawing to a more finished state. Imagine trying to build a
              large building without scaffolding to allow the workers to walk
              along elevated planes and do their work. The invention of
              scaffolding, cranes, and other means of constructive potency help
              to take something from concept to completion.
              <br />
              <br />
              There are thousands of ways to build various items from start to
              finish, but when it comes to drawing, we’re concerning ourselves
              with the types of guides and marks we make in order to align
              things proportionately, and construct them with relative
              efficiency.

          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>PROCESS</h2>
          <p>
            Construction harkens back to process. Process is the mother of
            construction. When you know your process, or at least have a rough
            outline of it, you’re in much better shape to succeed. Of course, I
            believe that practice is the goal, but the process is to be
            respected. <br /><br />
            Knowing how to start strong, carry yourself through the tough
            mid-points, and fill in the gaps as your finish as best you can will
            go a long way. A common process is to generate many rough ideas
            (thumbnails) that are small and easy to execute, then taking those
            rough ideas and scaling them up with more care and finesse.
            <br /><br />Finally, we start to lay in realized and rendered lines,
            values, shapes, and lighting. Starting with a vague and quick
            concept may only take 5 minutes, but winding through the process to
            the end result may take many pieces of paper, much reference,
            stopping to study elements that aren’t coalescing, and rendering for
            hours upon hours. What started as a 5-minute sketch could end up as
            a gorgeous 100-hour illustration— and the process is how we tackle
            that transition.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>FORM</h2>
          <div class="fundamental-content">
            <img src="images/form.jpg" alt="form" height="200" />
            <p>
              Form is something we touched upon in the earlier brackets of this
              list. It most often comes about when light and shadow intermix
              into a potent dimensionality. The way that form allows us to
              perceive volume and depth is wondrous, and when we learn to squint
              at objects and separate their various surface planes, form starts
              to make much more sense. Whether the object is simple and
              geometric, or complex and detailed, light will cast itself upon
              the object, which will always result in shadow as well. Once you
              understand how those two elements create either a flattening
              effect or a great visual “pop!” you’ll find that rendering any
              part of your drawing will start to get a little less intimidating.
              Start off shading spheres and cones, cubes as well. This will
              serve to broaden your horizons into more advanced forms like
              buildings, machines, people, and things found in nature.

          <h2>ANATOMY</h2>
          <div class="fundamental-content">
            <p>
              Anatomy is the subject of much frustration, but much fascination
              of most artists. There’s an anatomy to creatures, to people, to
              robots, to products, and to buildings. It’s about abstracting the
              various elements that make up any given thing, and using your
              knowledge of the way those elements “stack” to draw it. All of its
              proportions, placements, and perspectives (thanks, Andrew Loomis!)
              Anatomy is a vast rabbit hole unto itself (like all of these
              fundamentals) but you only need a certain degree of knowledge to
              execute with great verisimilitude the things you’re aiming to
              sketch. You won’t need to draw the organs of the body in order to
              draw it, but the skeletal system, muscular system, and the visible
              organs will certainly come into play.
